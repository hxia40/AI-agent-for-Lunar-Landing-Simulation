Reinforcement learning - 2020 Spring
Project 1


How to run the code:

The code is written in Python 3.6, relevant packages will need to be installed before running the code. 	
The version of these packages are:

	numpy - 1.17.2
	pandas - 0.25.1
	matplotlib - 3.1.1
	
Simply run the code for Figures 3, 4, and 5 to generate the best reproduction of Sutton 88's Figure 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The generated Figures from the three .py code files are also represented in the project report as Figure 1c, Figure 4c, and Figure 5b, respectively.
