###AI agent for Lunar Landing Simulation 
###Python, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenAI gym			                  

The AI agent for Lunar Landing Simulation is under folder Project 2. In this project, I have:
-	Independently developed a Reinforcement Learning agent using Deep Q-Network (implemented using Keras) to successfully land a â€œLunar Lander" in OpenAI gym, by reaching an average score of 240 (200 is required) over 100 consecutive episodes.
-	Implemented an experience replay pool of recent states to avoid local optima and stabilize the DQN training process.
-	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hyperparameters, including the size and layers of the neuron network, for the model.
